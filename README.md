## Installer and Executable
You can install the application by running setup.exe in https://github.com/EhsanPeymani/ChangeManagementTool/tree/master/Build/UpdateRegistryInstaller/Volume

By default it tries to unpack files at c:\changemanagementtool. You need to have write permission since the application creates files as it starts.

The executable is in https://github.com/EhsanPeymani/ChangeManagementTool/tree/master/Build/Main%20Applications

Remember that you need LabVIEW 2014 runtime engine.
